Have a Custom Server Texturepack?
Do you prefer Items by another name?

Change every item and block on your server to have the name you want them to have!

Features: changes existing items (in inventories) when accessed
items named when absorbed into chests, allowing named items to stack
can set names for subdata (and default names for those)
changes item crafting recipe names, so you can see them before you craft
Won't change items with existing names (via anvil)
- note: this means that for now, any name set cannot be reversed later
- 	can add the ability to rename item names set by this plugin if becomes an issue
